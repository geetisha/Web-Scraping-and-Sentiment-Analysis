R000002,Most Helpful,Highly Recommended,"I've been really impressed with the Microsoft Surface. My last one lasted over 10 years! I didn't replace it because it stopped working, I was simply ready for an upgrade. It’s durable, lightweight, and easy to use, which is a perfect fit for any student or administrator.",2025-03-03,5,JF1219,BestBuy Canada,Positive,['Good Design & Quality (Pos)']
R000003,Most Helpful,The best windows laptop !!,"This laptop is of a great quality. Finally Microsoft could produce a high quality ARM based laptop. The only issue is that, unfortunately, the battery cannot still compare with Macbook Air. I get around 10 hours of average usage with this laptop. But I still think this is the best ever windows laptop created",2025-02-25,5,Artyom,BestBuy Canada,Positive,['Good Design & Quality (Pos)']

R000006,Most Helpful,Perfect,"It’s a MacBook that doesn’t suck. Got the lowest tier with 512 SSD for school and work. It’s quick when using applications, but not the fastest when it comes to opening apps (maybe im just used to a G14). Worth the $971 out the door. Nice on the lap too, not too small.

R000014,Newest,Absolutely great for travel!,"As a person looking for battery longevity, this laptop quickly came to the top of my list. I do not use the laptop for a solid 8 hours -- it's not a work PC. However, I do use it on and off throughout the day and for mixed purposes (email, web browsing, watching videos). I have been able to go up to 3 days without recharging depending on my usage. When not in use, the laptop is in sleep mode - not shut down - so that I can open it back up and resume use. The battery consumption in sleep mode is extremely efficient. During a trip, the laptop was in sleep mode for nearly 20 hours before I opened it up again to use. The available battery life lost was about 2%. The screen, though not OLED, is also really good, providing ample brightness. The audio quality also sounds really good, though not as good as a current MacBook Pro. Some other non-essential but nice-to-have items like cases, screen protectors for the touchscreen, and keyboard covers are also available from various retailers, making it easier to keep scratch and dirt free. Once again, very similar to MacBooks. The only downside may be software compatibility. Definitely do your research and make sure the software you want to run will work on Windows-on-ARM CPUs like the Snapdragon X Plus and X Elite. If you need more SSD space, it is easily upgradable for those who are tech savvy. Directions on how to create a backup image (or recovery media) and to install a new SSD are readily available from the Microsoft website (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/surface-ssd-removal-guide). Best Buy also sells a WD SN770 2TB 2230 SSD that fits nicely in this laptop and is the one I used to replace the 512GB SSD the laptop came with. If battery life is essential and CPU compatibility isn't an issue, the Surface Laptop 7 offers great value for your money. The value is even greater when the laptop is on sale (such as at the time of the writing of this review). Overall, I'm very happy and impressed with this ARM PC. About the attached image: Image shows the laptop with a black protective case, glass screen protector, and keyboard protector. Not essential, but nice to have on a PC intended for traveling.",2025-01-20,5,fakecode,BestBuy Canada,Positive,['Good Design & Quality (Pos)']

R000016,Newest,MICROSOFT OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES!,"It's a beautiful piece of trash...It looks sleek and works well for a couple months. Then a barrage of issues come up - freezing, not maintaining connections with printer or iphone, losing files (which occasionally resurface). New windows pop up without being cued. It multiplies files - sometimes I've ended up with 5 copies of the same file. The battery loses charge quickly. Every day it does a new trick. This is the WORST computer I have ever owned. You ask if I'd recommend this item? Well, duh!",2025-01-14,1,FemmeDeMaison,BestBuy Canada,Negative,['Product Issues (Neg)']

R000018,Newest,Solid Windows Laptop,"I was needing a reliable Windows laptop that provided strong performance and solid battery life. This laptop definitely met those needs. Build quality is excellent, display is very nice. I'm easily getting 8+ hrs of use on a charge, and running most productivity apps I use on a daily basis is no problem for the laptop. I did run into some issues with the pre-installed OneDrive app...due to this computer having an ARM processor rather than x86.

R000021,Highest Rating,"Rock Solid Performance, Features, & Build Quality","Snapdragon? Whats this? If you can catch this On Sale, Its A Steal. This is probably one of the best made 13+ inch laptops on the market, for Windows. The battery life is more on par with a cell phone than a laptop. You can easily get through a day without packing a bulky charger in your bag. The screen is super color accurate for editing Photos or Video. Standby time? You dont have to worry about this little guy, you could probably have this in Sleep Mode for a week, but who could keep their hand off this fantastic device that long? Funny how when you have a device you can use all day, and have it be so portable, you find how much more you can get done. Instead of like traditional Intel and AMD units that turn into mini George Foreman grills after less than and hour, and that you do not want to use very long, making you run around looking for a power adapter after a way shorter time than you expected. If you need a Windows device that is solid all around, this Surface Laptop paired with this new Snapdragon Chipset, is plainly, awesome.",2024-12-23,5,SteveU,BestBuy Canada,Positive,['Good Design & Quality (Pos)']
R000022,Highest Rating,Microsoft knocked it out of the park!,"I have used a lot of laptops over the years and this laptop has ticked almost every single box. Here is a breakdown on my thoughts. Screen - Absolutely stunning for an IPS. Great color reproduction, great brightness, no screen bleed, and a fast 120hz refresh rate. I daily an OLED monitor, and yes they superior in a lot of ways, but this is still a great IPS monitor. Added bonus of not having to worry about burn in. Response time is okay, and I don't use the touch screen at all to be honest. Keyboard & Trackpad - Finally a nice haptic touchpad on a Windows laptop, thank you Microsoft. It is just as good if not better than my wife's MacBook Air M2. The keyboard is good as well. Comfortable to type on, backlighting is pleasant, and good travel distance. Chassis - Nice premium material. Feels great in the hands. Decent port selections with 1 USB A and 2 USB C 4.0. Performance - After initial setup and updates, I have notice zero issues or hiccups. Day to day tasks run smooth, and performance is more than enough for the average user. 16gb is nice to have on the base model instead of 8gb on a lot of other laptops. I upgraded the SSD with a 1tb Corsair MP 600 Mini. It has lower power consumption than the SanDisk/WD SN740 these come with. It also has faster read/write speeds but the average user will never notice. Battery life - This thing is excellent. I am charging my laptop about once a week. The idle drain on the battery is minimal at best. This is where I have notice most of the gains with this CPU. I can pick it up 3 days later and I have only lost 4-6% battery. You can't do that with an x86 CPU. I know Intel's Lunar Lake has made great strides in battery life but I still feel like this is superior. Compatibility - This is the only area I truly can knock the laptop. Yes, it is true that there are programs and games that are not compatible with this architecture. I do play a lot of games and my wife likes to photo edit. Adobe has been make strides in app compatibility and quite a bit of their suite now has an arm app. There will be a few professional apps that may never get an arm port and that's alright if you have access to another PC/MAC or you temper your expectations. As a gamer instead of just being mad that certain games don't work, I try and find what does and try them out. I am a huge Age of Empires player and fortunately all of the new Definitive Editions for the older games are compatible. www.worksonwoa.com - is a great site to check for games/apps that you may be interested in using on the laptop and I recommend you check it out before you purchase this to know what you might be missing out on. Overall - I think this is a great laptop. It is finally a MacBook Air for those of us that like or must use windows. Great chassis, great screen, great keyboard, great trackpad, amazing battery life, great performance. I know as Microsoft embraces ARM more, we will see greater compatibility for a lot of apps out there. 10/10 would recommend for most casual users, and tech nerds like me that understand the compatibility limitations on ARM at this point in time.",2024-12-15,5,ShovelGuy,BestBuy Canada,Positive,['Good Design & Quality (Pos)']

R000027,Highest Rating,Loving it!,"I wanted a light and portable laptop do to some work on the go, and I was doubtful about the snapdragon processor, but I tried the machine in store, and it was fantastic. I thought I would have issues with heavier workloads, but it went through without a problem. Like: HUGE battery life. I used it for 3 days, and I forgot to charge it, and there was not problem at all! It just kept going. Totally you can do light gamming if the game runs. Totally not for gamers. I have other laptops, and this one feels snappy, faster and responsive compared to them. The trackpad and keyboard is fantastic, the build impressive, I totally love it. Totally feels premium and have had no hardware issue. The screen is beautiful, and I am just using it for everything when I am out home. Dislike: Some small glitches with some x86 programs, but they are totally aesthetic and fix after a while.",2024-09-20,5,alfa33333,BestBuy Canada,Positive,['Good Design & Quality (Pos)']
